# SSH Brute Force Detection – Splunk SOC Lab

## Objective
Detect potential SSH brute force activity by identifying repeated failed authentication attempts in Linux SSH logs ingested into Splunk.

## Environment
- Linux (systemd / journalctl)
- Splunk Enterprise
- Home SOC Lab
- SSH-enabled host

## Data Source
- systemd journal logs
- SSH daemon (sshd) authentication events
- Failed SSH login attempts (invalid users and failed passwords)

## Detection Logic
- Monitor SSH authentication failures generated by the SSH daemon
- Identify patterns indicative of brute force behavior
- Validate repeated failed login attempts as a precursor to threshold-based alerting
- Detection can be expanded with field extraction and aggregation by source IP and username

## Splunk Search
```spl
index=main sourcetype="linux:sshd:journald"
("Failed password" OR "Invalid user")
